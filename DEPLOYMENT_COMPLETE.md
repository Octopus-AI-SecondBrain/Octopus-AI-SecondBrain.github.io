# Create PostgreSQL database → Copy Internal URL
# Create Web Service → Connect GitHub
# Add environment variables:
#   DATABASE_URL = <from database>
#   SECRET_KEY = <random 32 chars>
#   OPENAI_API_KEY = <your key>
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS = https://yourusername.github.io
# Wait 5-10 minutes for build
# Test: curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
```

### 2. Configure URLs (2 minutes)
```bash
# Update these files:
# 1. docs/index.html line 186: Demo link URL
# 2. frontend/src/utils/api.js: API base URL
# 3. backend/main.py: Add GitHub Pages to CORS
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend (3 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/noel.thomas/secondbrain
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to production"
git push origin main

# Go to GitHub → Settings → Pages
