Machine Learning Fundamentals
# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of ML
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data (classification, regression)
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error with rewards

## Key Concepts
- Training data vs test data
- Overfitting and underfitting
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation metrics

Machine learning powers many modern applications like recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing.

Neural Networks Deep Dive
# Neural Networks

Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

## Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform data
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions

## Training Process
1. Forward propagation: Data flows through network
2. Loss calculation: Measure error
3. Backpropagation: Adjust weights to minimize error
4. Repeat until convergence

## Common Types
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - for images
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - for sequences
- Transformers - for natural language

Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning and modern AI systems.

Vector Embeddings Explained
# Vector Embeddings

Embeddings convert discrete data (words, images, etc.) into continuous vector representations.

## Why Embeddings?
- Capture semantic meaning
- Enable similarity comparisons
- Reduce dimensionality
- Work well with neural networks

## Text Embeddings
Transform words or sentences into vectors where similar meanings have similar vectors.

Example: "king" - "man" + "woman" â‰ˆ "queen"

## How This App Uses Embeddings
1. Each note is converted to a vector
2. Similar notes have similar vectors
3. Cosine similarity finds related notes
4. Neural map visualizes these connections

## Popular Models
- Word2Vec (2013)
- GloVe (2014)
- BERT (2018)
- Sentence Transformers (2019)
- OpenAI Embeddings (2022+)

Embeddings are the secret sauce behind semantic search!

Graph Databases vs Relational Databases
# Graph vs Relational Databases

## Relational Databases (SQL)
- Tables with rows and columns
- Relationships via foreign keys
- ACID transactions
- Great for structured data
- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL

**Use when:**
- Data has clear schema
- Need complex queries across tables
- Require strong consistency

## Graph Databases
- Nodes and relationships as first-class citizens
- No need for joins
- Traversal-based queries
- Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

**Use when:**
- Data is highly connected
- Need path finding
- Relationships are as important as entities
- Social networks, knowledge graphs

## Hybrid Approach
This SecondBrain app uses:
- SQLite for note storage (relational)
- Vector embeddings for semantic relationships (graph-like)
- Best of both worlds!
