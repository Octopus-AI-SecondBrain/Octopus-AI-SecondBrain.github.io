  - üü† Orange: Popular (5-10 connections)
  - üü£ Purple: Connected (1-5 connections)
  - ‚ö´ Gray: Isolated (0 connections)

- **Connection strength** visualization:
  - Link thickness represents similarity
  - Link opacity shows relationship strength
  - Animated glow effects

- **Real-time statistics**:
  - Total notes count

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Hub nodes** (most connected) are largest and gold
2. **Popular nodes** are orange and medium-sized
3. **Regular nodes** are purple and standard size
4. **Isolated nodes** are gray and smaller

### Connection Visualization
- Thicker lines = stronger semantic similarity
- More opaque = higher relationship confidence
- Color gradient based on connection strength

### User Experience
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive to all screen sizes
- Clear visual feedback
- Intuitive controls
- Helpful tooltips and legends
